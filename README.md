# NativeDump - "python-flavour" branch

This branch implements the same functionality as the main branch but using Python3. You can run it as a script:

```
python nativedump.py
```

As an alternative, you can compile it to a single binary using pyinstaller with the "-F" flag:

 ```
pyinstaller -F nativedump.py
```
